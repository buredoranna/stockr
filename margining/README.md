This directory hold scenarios of having borrowed X number of dollars in year Y.

19.67x = 35
x = 35 / 19.67 = 1.77

leveraged three to one
collateral 5k for 15k 

15000 / 20 = 750 shares

                         (value of shares ) - (value of loan plus interest) = (profit)
750 shares @ $35/share = $26250             - $16120                        = $10125
                                                

putting up $5k as collateral to buy 750 shares of USO @ $20/share.

If USO dropped 30% to $14/share, the value of the loan would be $10.5k, down $5k, which I would then have to deposit as collateral.

On top of the $100/month I would have to pay as loan maintenance.

Since I bought 1000 shares of UWTI @ $3.51/share

$3510x = $13635
x = 3.89 times

So to get the same dollar amount from my UWTI investment as from the "leverage by margin investment" 
method, UWTI has to reach $13.7/share
